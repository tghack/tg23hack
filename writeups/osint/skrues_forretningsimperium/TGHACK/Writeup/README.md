## Writeup

Writing a writeup may be a hard task. Therefore, I will try to explain how to write it here.

1. So the first step to write a write up, is to explain how to solve the task.

2. Explaining how to solve the tasks, may be separated into several steps. That will make it easier to undertsand the text and learn from it.

Write explanatory text so that your grandma or nephew can understand. Explain all tools used to solve the task.

To solve the task of writing a writeup, I used **markdown**.
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.
You can read more about markdown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

I could not only use markdown to solve the task, I also used **Github**.
To understand what Github is, you should know what Git is.
Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer
files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
You can read more about Git [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).
So, now that you now about Git, it is easier to understand what github is,
which is a web-based Git and Internet hosting service, which is mostly used for code.
Read more about Github [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) or go to their [website](https://github.com).

I also had this peace of code or text
that should be separated with a markdown-box
by using three back-ticks above and under
the text.

And then... Whoop whoop, I got the flag!
